dotfiles
========

These Vim settings are largely copied from [Steve Losh's](http://stevelosh.com/blog/2010/09/coming-home-to-vim/)
['dotfiles'](http://bitbucket.org/sjl/dotfiles/src) repository on bitbucket.org (a Mercurial repo hub) so
I couldn't simply fork it on github. The main purpose of this repo to make my
favorite MacVim settings available to me anywhere, and anyone else is welcome
to use and extend them. There is a much bigger emphasis on Perl support than
Steve's files which are much more Ruby oriented.

Of course, it would be nicer to use [Padre](http://padre.perlide.org/) but it's not quite there yet.
