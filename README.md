dotfiles
========

These Vim settings are largely copied from Steve Losh's
(http://stevelosh.com/blog/2010/09/coming-home-to-vim/) dotfiles repository on
bitbucket.org (http://bitbucket.org/sjl/dotfiles/src) (a Mercurial repo hub) so
I couldn't simply fork it on github. The main purpose of this repo to make my
favorites MacVim settings available to me anywhere, and anyone else is welcome
to use and extend them. There is a much bigger emphasis on Perl support than
Steve's files which are much more Ruby oriented.

Of course, it would be nicer to use Padre (http://padre.perlide.org/) but it's not quite there yet.

Installation
------------

Clone the repository into your home directory and create a symbolic link to the
vim subdirectory e.g.:
  ln -s dotfiles/vim .vim
