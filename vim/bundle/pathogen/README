Pathogen is a simple library for manipulating comma delimited path options. Add this to your vimrc:

  call pathogen#runtime_append_all_bundles()

After adding this, you can take any plugin, unzip/untar/svn-checkout/git-clone it to its own private directory in .vim/bundle, and it will be added to the runtime path.  This makes it easy to remove or update each plugin individually.

The full list of functions includes:

pathogen#split: convert a comma delimited option to an array
pathogen#join: convert an array to a comma delimited option
pathogen#glob: wrapper around glob() that returns an array
pathogen#runtime_prepend_subdirectories: prepend all subdirectories of a path to the runtimepath and append all after subsubdirectories
pathogen#runtime_append_all_bundles: for each directory in the runtime path, look for a "bundle" entry and add the subdirectories of it to the path, as with runtime_prepend_subdirectories
